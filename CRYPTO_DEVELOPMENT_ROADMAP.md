    # Implement 35-dimensional chromatic space -> frequency encryption matrix
    # Enharmonic relationships -> chaos multiplication factors
    # XML step + alter mapping -> dimensional transformation rules
```

```python
def _extract_lambda_crypto_primitives(self):
    # Implement octave relationships -> dimensional scaling
    # 8 octave positions -> multi-layer encryption depth
    # Register mathematics -> data folding algorithms
```

### Week 8: Epsilon Mathematics Extraction
```python

    # Step 2: Apply Chi temporal transformations
    temporal_encrypted = self.apply_chi_transformations(math_representation)
    
    # Step 3: Apply Theta frequency domain encryption
    frequency_encrypted = self.apply_theta_transformations(temporal_encrypted)
    
    # Step 4: Apply Lambda dimensional scaling
    scaled_encrypted = self.apply_lambda_scaling(frequency_encrypted)
    
    # Step 5: Apply Epsilon chaos injection
    final_encrypted = self.apply_epsilon_chaos(scaled_encrypted)
    
    # Step 6: Apply mod table context variations
    context_encrypted = self.apply_mod_table_context(final_encrypted)
    
    return context_encrypted
